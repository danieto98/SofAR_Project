# SofAR_Project

This is a repository developed as a group proect for the course of Software Architecture for Robotics-86805 at the University of Genoa.

The goal of the project is to combine SLAM with voice recognition and semantic labeling within a closed environment. 
The mobile robot used is an Husqvarna, connected to a RaspberryPi, Kinect for RGBD data, a microphone, and a Smartwatch to teleoperate it. 

The robot is expected to navigate an area, through smartwatch teleoperation, and acquire labels for objects when a voice command is sent. Then, is expected to move between labelled objects once voice commands are given through the microphone.
